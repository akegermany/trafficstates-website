<p>The analysis of the complete image data base (check "any" in the
      input mask) suggests that there
      are three factors for traffic breakdown.</p>
<br>
<p> At first, we notice that nearly all traffic breakdowns occur at or
      near a 
    <i>bottleneck</i>. In the images of the database, a bottleneck can
      be consituted by </p>
<ul>
<li> <b>Freeway intersections:</b>
 "Westkreuz" near  Kilometer 492, "Nordwestkreuz" at km 488,
	"Autobahnkreuz  Bad Homburg" at km 480), see
<a href="html/userimages/sketch_a5.png">Sketch of the A5 section</a>. 
</li><br>
<li> <b>Junctions:</b>
"AS Friedberg" at km 471.
</li><br>

<li> <b>Uphill and downhill grades: </b> There is a significant uphill grade at the
<a href="html/userimages/sketch_a5.png">A5-North</a>
 around kilometer 477-478. The corresponding downhill grade on the
      A5-South seems not to have a significant influence. Another
      infamous hilly section is the 
<a href="html/userimages/A8EsketchWithOnramp_ger.png">section "Irschenberg"</a> 
on the German freeway  A8-east, where similar congestions are observed.
</li><br>
<li> <b>Accidents:</b> At various locations. Enter "Accident" in the
      full-text string search to find instances in the image data base.
</li><br>

<li> <b>Special cases:</b> Examples are 
(<i>moving bottlenecks</i>) by heavy-duty special transports or median
      lawn mowing (enter "moving" in the full-text search), but also
      behaviour-induced bottlenecks such as "rubbernecking" when there
      is a spectacular accident in the opposite direction leading to a
      temporarily and locally less efficient driving style although
      there is no <i> physical</i> obstruction of any
      kind. (Unfortunately, we did not find conclusive examples in the
      image database. If you find one, we would be very happy to know)
 </li>
</ul>

<br><span id="bildunterschrift">Example of a traffic breakdown</span></span>
<!-- ################################# -->

<p>Furthermore, as also suggested by common sense, a sufficiently
      high <i>traffic demand</i> (in relation to the capacity) is necessary
      for a traffic breakdown: Jams are rarely observed during the
      small hours of the night although most bottlenecks are active during these periods
      as well.</br>

<br>
Finally, as third ingredient, one needs a <i> final trigger</i> in
      form of an abrupt/inconsiderate driving maneuver provoking a
      considerable perturbation. Trucks overtaking each other at small
      speed differences ("running elephants") and the resulting
      vehicle platoon can also serve as such a
      final trigger.
 

   
    <p>These factors can be summarized by the 
    <i>three ingredients to make a jam</i> (cf. the
<a href="html/userimages/A5S_2001_09_25.vel_3d_en.xfig.png">figure to
	the left </a>):</p>
<ol>
<li> <b>High traffic demand.</b> In the example depicted by the above
	image, this is the morning rush hour.</li>
<li> <b> Bottleneck.</b> In this example, it is consituted by the exit
	ramps of the "Nordwestkreuz
	Frankfurt".</li>
<li> <b> Final trigger.</b> Here, the triggering perturbation
	consists of a bounded region where the local speed drops to
	80 km/h propagating at about the same speed.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the <a
	href="html/userimages/A5S_2001_09_25.vel_3d_en.xfig.png">example image above,</a> 
there is evidence that the perturbation is caused by "running
      elephants" (trucks overtaking each other at slow speed
      difference): Due to the high traffic demand, a platoon
      of following vehicles forms behind the trucks. In the figure,
      this corresponds to a dark green spatiotemporal region (local speed
      about 80 km/h) propagating in driving direction with the cars
      (propagation velocity=local speed) at about 7:10 through the
      considered region. Further evidence for "running elephants"
      cause is given by the local traffic flow which is increased
      inside this region (not shown). As soon as the perturbation (the platoon) crosses the
      bottleneck, all three factors are true, and the actual breakdown
      (light green, yellow, and red regions) occurs at 7:10 near the road kilometer 488.</p>


<h2 id="stylizedFacts">Qualitative Features of Jam Propagation: The "Stylized Facts</h2>
<p>The images of the database as well as spatiotemporal patterns of
      jams of other traffic congestions on European and US freeways show
      remarkable similarities. On a qualitative level, they can be
      summarized by following rules, also known as <i>stylized facts</i>:</p>

<!-- ################################# -->
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h4>(1) Congestions may be localized (fixed spatial extension), or extended.</h4>
<p>An extended congestion such as in the 
<a href="html/userimages/A9S_1998_10_29_en.png">left image of the
	figure above</a> has a variable spatial extension while
      localized congestions (or jam waves) such as these in the
<a href="html/userimages/A5S_2001_06_06_en.png">right image of the
	figure above</a>,
have a fixed spatial extension of typically 1 km.</p>

<h4> (2) The downstream jam front is either
      stationary or moves with the characteristic constant speed <i>c</i>.</h4>

<p>This is valid both for 
<a href="html/userimages/A5S_2001_06_06_en.png">localized </a> 
and
<a href="html/userimages/A9S_1998_10_29_en.png">extended congestions</a>.
In the case of localized congestions, one speaks of standing or moving
      traffic waves. In the case of extended congestions such as in 
 <a href="html/userimages/A9S_1998_10_29_en.png">this example from the
	freeway A9</a>, the property of the
      downstream jam front can change abruptly from being stationary to
      moving (but not the other way round).</p>

<p>The propagation velocity  <i>c</i> with values between -15 km/h und
      -20 km/h (depending on the driving style and vehicle composition
      but not on the congestion pattern) is the same as that of the
      position of starting vehicles in a queue of vehicles behind a
      traffic light. It corresponds also to the parameter
      <i>c<sub>cong</sub></i> of the <a
      href="www.traffic-states.com/methode_en.html"> adaptive smoothing
      method</a> used for generating the images.</p>

<h4> (3) The upstream front of congestions is determined by supply and demand.</h4>

<!-- ################################## -->
<span id="bildlinks">
<a href="html/userimages/A8E_1997_07_11_en.png"><img src="html/userimages/A8E_1997_07_11_en_small.png" alt="A8-Ost M&uuml;nchen-Salzburg beim Irschenberg"></a>
<br><span id="bildunterschrift">A8-East munich-Salzburg near the "Irschenberg"</span>
</span>
<!-- ################################# -->

<p>The propagation velocity can be determined by making use of vehicle
      number conservation leading directly to the well-known
      shock-wave formula 
<p>
<center>
<table class="equation"><tr><td class="equation">
velocity of upstream front=difference of flow / difference of
	density
</td></tr></table></center>

<p>
between the regions of free and congested traffic separated by this
    boundary. From this and the above stylized facts it follows that
    this velocity is in the range between <i>c</i> (about -15 km/h)
    and the threshold speed <i>V<sub>c</sub></i> between free and
    congested traffic (about 45 km/h). 
Particularly, the velocity is positive (the congestion is shrinking)
    if the supply (i.e., the capacity at the bottleneck) is larger
    than the upstream traffic demand, see 
<a href="html/userimages/A8E_1997_07_11_en.png"> this figure</a> after
    about 19:00. Otherwise, the velocity is
    negative (the congestion grows in upstream direction) as in the
    above figure before 19:00.</p>

<h4>(4) The propagation velocity of perturbations/patterms inside
      extended jams is given by the constant value <i>c</i>c.</h4>

<p>
Nearly all extended congestions show internal oscillations or <i>
	stop-and-go waves</i>. With the exception of the upstream
      front itself (see Fact 3 above), the propagation velocity of
      <i>all</i> moving structures inside congestions moves at this
      speed. This includes  moving downstream fronts (Fact 2).

The analysis of microscopic traffic models such as the <i>Intelligent
	Driver Model</i> shows that this velocity can be expressed
      by</p>

<center><table class="equation"><tr><td class="equation">
c&nbsp;=&nbsp;-(vehicle length + minimum gap) &nbsp;/&nbsp; Net time
	    gap in car-following mode,
</td></tr></table></center>

<p>for example</p>

<center><table class="equation"><tr><td class="equation">
c&nbsp;=&nbsp;-(5 m + 2 m)&nbsp;/&nbsp;(1.4 s)&nbsp;=&nbsp;-5 m/s &nbsp;=&nbsp;-18 km/h.
</td></tr></table></center>

<p>Of course, one must consider averages over the vehicle fleet and
      the different driving styles.
      Since the typical vehicle on US roads is longer
      compared to the typical European vehicle, the absolute value of
      <i>c</i> depends weakly on the country (typically, -18 km/h in
      the USA and -15 km/h in Europe).</p>

<h4>(5) Oscillations inside extended congestions grow as they
      propagate.</h4>

<!-- ################################## -->
<span id="bildlinks">
<!--<a href="JavaScript:newPopup('html/userimages/A5S_2001_06_11.png');">-->

 <br><span id="bildunterschrift">A5-South, congestions caused (from
	left to right) by a junction, an intersection, and an
	accident, respectively.</span>
 </span>
<!-- ################################# -->
<p>In most cases, congested traffic flow is essentially stationary
      near the downstream front
 (see <a href="html/userimages/A5S_2001_06_11_en.png">the image to the
	left</a>).
However, during the course of time, small perturbations develop to
      traffic oscillations,  and sometimes even to isolated traffic waves.</p> 

<h4>(6) The wavelength and period of the oscillations tends to decrease with the severity
      of the bottleneck.</h4>

<p>This means that, in contrast to the <i> propagation velocity</i>,
      the <i> wavelength</i> is not a "traffic constant". The period
      varies between 4 min (severe congestions) and about 20 min
      (light congestions) corresponding to wavelengths between 1 km
      and 5 km, respectively. </p>
<p>For example, in  <a href="html/userimages/A9S_1998_10_29.png">this
	spatiotemporal speed profile of traffic on the A9</a>,
 the intersection "Munich North" represents a more severe bottleneck
      compared to the intersection 
      "Neufahrn", and correspondingly produces traffic waves of a
      higher frequency. The same applies to the 
 <a href="html/userimages/A8E_1997_07_11_en.png">complex composite
	congestion on the A8:</a> The congestion caused by an accident
      contains traffic waves of a higher frequency compared to the
      congestions caused by the gradients of the 
      "Irschenberg".</p>

<h4> (7) Very weak or very strong bottlenecks may cause extended
      congestion without significant oscillations.</h4>

<p>Enter "HST" (homogeneous synchronized traffic, light bottleneck),
      or "HCT" or "Accident" (homogeneous congested traffic, strong
      bottleneck) into the <a href="?site=searchhelp&lang=en">fulltext

<p>As all rules, also the <i> Stylized Facts of Traffic Patterns</i>
      have an exception. It is related to <i>moving</i>
	  bottlenecks that may be caused, e.g., by special heavy
      transports, "running elephant" races of particularly slow
      trucks, or by moving road works such as mowing the median
      lawn. Enter the keyword "moving" in the 
 <a href="?site=searchhelp&lang=en"> search mask</a> to see some examples.
Such moving bottlenecks may cause congestions (see
<a href="images/screen/A5N_Wed_2001_08_15.0493_0463.12_20.gasm_v2d.png">
this example)</a>, or not, as in
<a href="images/screen/A5S_Tue_2001_05_22.0465_0492.06_14.gasm_v2d.png">
this example</a>.</p>

<p>If congestions are caused, the moving downstream front violates
     <i>Stylized Fact</i> No. 2. However,  this rule  can be generalized
      to include moving bottlenecks:</p>

<h5> (2a) The downstream front moves either with a velocity equal to
      that of the bottleneck, or with the velocity  c</h5>
<p>The other <i>Stylized
      Facts</i> remain unchanged. Note that the velocity of the
      bottleneck may be positive or negative.</p>
      
<p>By the way: For the case of  <i>moving bottlenecks</i>, the
      distinction between Jam Ingredient No. 3 ("perturbations inside
      the traffic flow") and No. 1 ("bottleneck") smears out: "Running
      elephants" can be considered either as a <i>moving
	bottleneck</i>, or as a perturbation inside the flow. This
      ambiguity becomes irrelevant when defining two sets of "three
      ingredients": Either </p>

<p>
For a <emph>quantitative<emph> understanding of the traffic instabilities, one
	can investigate the characteristic features of the
	oscillations arising in extended congestions,
<ul>
<li> growth rates,</li>
<li> wave lengths,</li>
<li> and propagation velocities</li>
</ul>
as a function of the bottleneck strength.</p>

<p>All four quantities (the features and the bottleneck strength itself) can be
	determined from the <a href="html/userimages/A5S_2001_05_07_tseries1Fig.png">
speed time series of several neighboring detector cross sections</a>,
	at least indirectly.</p>

<h4> Bottleneck strength </h4>

<p>The bottleneck itself, definied as the degree of reduction of the
	  local capacity with respect to the neighboring sections,
	  cannot be determined directly. However, the bottleneck
	  strength is highly correlated witht he <emph>speed of
	  congested traffic</emph> immediately upstream of the
	  bottleneck: Obviously, the higher the bottleneck strength,
	the lower the speed at this location, cf. the 
<a href="?site=theorie&lang=en#phaseDia">
derivation of the phase diagram</a>. Therefore, we take this
	speed  as directly measurable 
	  <emph>instrument variable </emph> for the bottleneck
	  strength.</p>
	  
<p>Notice that, according to Stylized Fact No. 5, the speed
	variations at this location are small such that this
	  instrument variable 
	generally is well-defined.</p>


<h4> Propagation velocity </h4>

<p>From the <a
	    href="html/userimages/A5S_2001_05_07_tseries1Fig.png">time
	    series</a>, one obtains the propagation velocity by
	  shifting the time series of adjacent detectors relative to
	  each other until the first nontrivial peak
 of the correlation is obtained (of course, the trivial global maximum
	  is obtained for a relative shift of zero). Then, the
	  propagation velocity is simply given by
	  detectors  divided by 

<center><table class="equation"><tr><td class="equation">
 propagation velocity <i>c</i> &nbsp;=&nbsp;
		<i>&tau;<sub>shift</sub></i> &nbsp;/&nbsp; (distance
		between detectors).
</td></tr></table></center>

<p>An <a href="html/userimages/patternPropagVel_ger.png">evaluation of
	    the data behind the image data base</a>
resulted in remarkably constant values for <i>c</i> both for extended
	  congestions (OCT and TSG) and moving localized jams
	  (MLC). 
(Notice that all these abbreviations OCT,TSG, MLC 
 are searchable by entering them in the full-text search mask of
	  the image database.)
This agrees with <i>Stylized Fact</i> No. 4. </p>


<h4> Wavelength </h4>

<p>One can read the average period directly from the
 <a href="html/userimages/A5S_2001_05_07_tseries1Fig.png">
speed time series</a> of detetors where the traffic waves can be
	  distinguished clearly from noise but are not yet saturated. In
<a href="html/userimages/A5S_2001_05_07_tseries1Fig.png">this
	    figure</a>, the suitable region is between the road
	  kilometers 474 and 477. Using the propagation velocity
	  <i>c</i> determined earlier, this also gives us the
	  wavelength
<i>&lambda;</i>:</p>

<center><table class="equation"><tr><td class="equation">
Wavelength <i>&lambda;</i> &nbsp;=&nbsp; |<i>c</i>| &#183; <i>&tau;</i>
</td></tr></table></center>

<p>A systematic evaluation of the data behind the images resulted in
	  the 
<a href="html/userimages/patternWavelength_ger.png">depicted dependency</a>
of the wavelength with respect to the bottleneck strength:
The wavelength reduces with the bottleneck strength (with reduced
	  speed at the bottleneck) until a minimum value of about 1.5
	  km is reached for speeds smaller than about 25 km/h (to see
	  some examples, enter "OCT" into the 
<a href="?site=searchhelp&lang=en">search mask</a>).
On the other hand, for very small bottleneck strengths, one obtains
	  isolated traffic waves (enter "TSG" into the
<a href="?site=searchhelp&lang=en">search mask</a>) for which the
	  definition of a wavelength no longer makes sense.
All this is in agreement with  <i>Stylized Fact</i> No. 6.</p>

<h4> Growth rate </h4>

<p>Finally, one can determine the

 from the detector data. The spatiotemporal region to determine this
	  quantity is the same as that for determining the

the oscillations 
	  from noise but they may not be saturated. 
Otherwise, the growth rate cannot be determined (only noise), or is
	  biased to lower values (saturation). In our example,
	  this is satisfied between the road kilometers 474 und 477.
          Sufficiently far away
	  from the saturation, the growth rate is exponential, in a
	  good approximation. This means, the average amplitude (of
	  the speed oscillations) can be
	  modelled by</p>

<center><table class="equation"><tr><td class="equation">
<i>A</i> &nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>A<sub>0</sub></i> &#183; e<sup><i>&sigma;(t-t<sub>0</sub>)</i></sup>.
</td></tr></table></center>

<p>By means of the time shifts &tau; already needed for calculating the
	  propagation velocity, the growth rate <i>&sigma;</i> can be
	  determined by </p>

<center><table class="equation"><tr><td class="equation">
<i>&sigma;</i> &nbsp;=&nbsp; 1/<i>&tau;</i><sub>shift</sub> &#183; ln(<i>A<sub>up</sub></i>/<i>A<sub>down</sub></i>).
</td></tr></table></center>

<p>The <a href="html/userimages/patternGrowthrate.png">result</a>
    agrees with the <i>Stylized Facts</i> Nr. 5 and
    7: The growth rate of congested traffic is positive (growing
	  waves) with the exception of very light or very severe
	  congestions, and it is negative (traffic flow is stable with
	  respect to perturbations) for free traffic. (However,
	  negative growth rates cannot be determined with the method
	  described above since no oscillations exist in this case; it
	  has been determined differently.) </p>
