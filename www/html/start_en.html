<h1>Traffic Jams: A Collective Phenomenon in Space and Time</h1>
</div>
<div id="usercontent">
<!-- <h2 id="about"></h2> -->
<p>
Probably everybody knows traffic jams by his or her own
    experience. However, when driving through (or being stuck in) 
a congestion, one experiences only a
    small fraction of the jam. In reality, traffic congestions are
    collective spatiotemporal phenomena, often extending over many
    kilometers, and sometimes over several hours.</p> 

<p>So we wonder how a jam would look like from the "bird's eye view". Are
      there several characteristic types of jams? What are the
      commonalities, what the differences? What are the influencing
      factors for a traffic breakdown? Is there such a thing as a
      "phantom traffic jam"?  </p>

<p>These questions about the <i>dynamics of vehicular traffic flow in
	space and time
      </i> is the motivation for setting up this web
      presentation. They will be illustrated by means of empirical
      examples and an expansive <emph>searchable image database of real
      congestions</emph> .</p>

<p>An example from the image database is shown in  
<a
	href="html/userimages/A5S_2001_06_11_en.png">this figure</a>.
Illustrated is the <i>local speed</i> (color-coded) of the vehicles driving at a
      given location (y axis) and a given time instant (x axis), averaged over 
      all lanes. The speed has been determined from one-minute
      detector data by a 
<a href="?site=methode&lang=en">dedicated method</a> 
</a>. </p> 

<p>
The figure shows congested traffic on the German freeway A5-South near
      Frankfurt. The congestions are caused by traffic breakdowns at
      the intersections "Friedberg" and "Bad Homburg", and (probably caused by an
      accident) at road kilometer 476. 
Notice that all congested regions exhibit
<a href="?site=phaenomene&lang=en#stylizedFacts">traffic waves</a>
      which propagate against the direction of travel (at about 15
      km/h). The initially independent two congested
      areas merge to a complex congestion at about 9:00h and
"activate" a third
      bottleneck at about kilometer 471.</p>

<p>After entering  a driving direction (North or South) in the 
search mask to the left, you can display and search the 
<a href="html/userimages/trafficstates.com.png">congestions on the
	A5</a> 
during six months in the mid of 2001 (see also the

<a href="?site=searchhelp&lang=en">seach hints</a>).</p>

<p>
This freeway section is one of the most investigated in traffic
      science since it provides a high number of densily spaced
      <a href="?site=daten&lang=en">induction loop detectors</a>.
Moreover, traffic breakdowns occur
      frequently.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the capacity of this section has been greatly
      improved by adding a forth lane in each direction, and by an
      improved traffic management (including a temporary opening of the
      emergency lanes during peak hours), see the
<a href="http://www.staufreieshessen2015.de">Initiative Staufreies
	Hessen 2015</a> ("Congestion-free federal state Hessen").
Consequently, at present, traffic
      breakdowns occur less frequently on this section. This is bad
      news for the traffic researchers, but definitely good news for
      the drivers;-) .</p>
