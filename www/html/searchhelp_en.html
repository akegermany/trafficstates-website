<p><emph> Notice</emph>: All the following relates to the search mask on the left-hand side.</p>

<h2>Route</h2>
<p>After selecting the <i>Highway</i> and the  (driving)
      <i>Direction</i>, the search mask for a section becomes
      active. At present, the data base containes spatiotemporal speed
      profile of the German freeway A5 for the driving directions
      North and South.</p>

<p>Notice that the morning rush hour produces traffic jams mainly in
      the southern direction, while the afternoon rush hour mostly
      affects the direction to the north. </p>


<h2>Time</h2>
<p>You can select the period by indicating  the first day ("from") and
      the last day ("to"). Additionally, you can filter with respect
      to  <i>days</i> (of the week), and the  <i>daytime</i> (morning,
      afternoon, whole day). </p>
<p> Notice that
      similar patterns are often observed on same days of the week. </p>

<h2>Traffic Pattern</h2>
<p>The congestion images are discriminated with respect to the
      elementary <i>spatiotemporal patterns</i> which can be organized
      in a so-called <a href="?site=theorie&lang=en"> dynamic phase
	diagram </a>. One instance of a congestion may
      contain several  elementary patterns. The
      patterns and their searchable abbreviations are the following:</p>

<h4>MLC: Moving Localized Cluster</h4>
<p>Isolated moving jam waves.</p>

<h4>PLC: Pinned Localized Cluster</h4>
<p>Isolated standing waves that are fixed, or <i>pinned</i>, at a
      bottleneck. This type of pattern typically occurs if the traffic
      demand is too low for causing an extended congestion such as
      TSG, OCT, or HCT.</p>

<h4>TSG: Triggered Stop-and-Go</h4>
<p>Moving jam waves emanating from a localized or extended zone of
      essentially stationary congested traffic near the bottleneck.</p> 

<h4>OCT: Oscillating Congested Traffic</h4>
<p>Extended congestion with distinct internal traffic
      oscillations. The TSG and OCT states are also referred to as <i>
	stop-and-go traffic</i>. </p>

<h4>HCT: Homogeneous Congested Traffic</h4>
<p>Homogeneous and stationary "creeping traffic" which
      typically occurs behind strong bottlenecks such as lane
      closings and accidents. This includes the trivial case of
      completely stopped traffic behind a complete road closure (or a
      red traffic light).</p>





<h2>Further comments</h2>
<p>Each image includes a documentation about the specifics of the
      corresponding congestion (see <a
	href="JavaScript:newPopup('html/userimages/A5S_2001_05_22_example.png');">this example</a>). The text of this documentation is
      searchable by the <i> full text search</i> box. Some relevant
      keywords are the following (for further keywords, just look at
      some documentation fields): </p>
