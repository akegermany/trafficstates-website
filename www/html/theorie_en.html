<h1>Phase Diagram of Traffic Patterns</h1>
</div>

<div id="usercontent">
<p>The observed spatiotemporal patterns of congested traffic flow can
      be categorized by a <i>dynamic phase diagram</i>, thereafter
      shortly called <i> phase diagram</i> (although it is not a phase
      diagram in the thermodynamic sense).
The phase diagram denotes the qualitative spatiotemporal properties of
      a given congested region as a function of the traffic demand,
      and the bottleneck strength (see also the section on
      "phenomena"). Furthermore, the phase diagram depends on the
      <a href="#stabilityDia">stability properties </a> of the traffic
      flow which, in turn, are influenced by the real or simulated
    <i>driving style</i>, i.e., by the type and the parameters of the
      traffic flow model. </p>

<h2 id="jamProperties">Stability of Traffic Flow</h2>
<p>
The following phenomenon is known to every car driver: If the  driver of the
      leading vehicle brakes (for whatever reason), and there is no
      possibility to change lanes and overtake, one must brake as well
      in order to avoid a rear-end collision. However, during the
      reaction time and the subsequent deceleration time, one keeps
      approaching the leading vehicle. As a consequence, the new
      distance gap to the leader may be smaller than the new safety gap,
      although the latter is reduced with the reduced speed. This happens
      especially if 
<ul> 
<li>the road is sufficiently crowded,
<li> and the driver's responsiveness (<i>agility</i>)
      is low.
</ul></p>

<p>If the new gap is smaller than the new safety gap, it is necessary to
    <emph>further</emph> reduce the speed in order to obtain the
    safety gap again. This means, the driver <i>following</i> 
 the considered driver must react to a stronger braking maneuver,
    compared to that imposed on the considered driver. This results in
    an even <i>lower</i> minimum speed of the follower. Consequently, the next
    driver must brake <i>even more</i>. This meachanism unfolds  until
    eventuall the drivers experience a temporary complete
    standstil: A <i>stop-and-go wave</i> has emerged. </p>

<p> From this mechanism, it follows that this "vicious cycle" can be
      broken by
<ul>
<li> a high responsiveness and an agile driving style,</li>
<li> anticipative driving,</li>
<li> and a sufficient safety gap.
</ul>
</p>

<p>Furthermore, it is evident that this mechanism is not effective if
      there is only light traffic: In this case, a given follower
      has "equilibrated" his or her distance gap during the time the
       next follower needs to approach within interaction distance.

<p>
The figure to the left  illustrates this mechanism by showing the
      spatiotemporal evolution of the average local speed of a long
      platoon of identical vehicles following each other in dense
      traffic. At time t=0, a small perturbation has been introduced
      to the vehicles near the location x=0 (which may be
      caused by lane changes, nonperfect driving styles, or other).

Depending on the agility of the drivers, different types of traffic
      instabilities occur (the density and the initial 
      speed  is the same in
      all four simulations):
<ul>



<li> <b>High agility</b> (top left): The initial perturbation
	vanishes: Traffic is <i>string stable</i>.</li>
<li> <b> Moderate agility</b> (top right): The traffic oscillations
	increase. However, they propagate <i>only in the upstream
      direction</i>. Consequently, at the location of the initial
	perturbation, the oscillations fade away after some time. If
	there is no further perturbation, the 
	waves eventually are "convected out" of the considered road
	section. This mild form of string instability is called <i>
	  (upstream-) convective instability</i>.</li>

<li> <b> Low agility, sluggish driving style</b> (bottom right):
The oscillations grow and propagate in <i> both </i>
	directions. Sooner or later, there are oscillations everywhere
	even if there is no further perturbation.
<li> The limiting case between these two stability types (moderate to low
	agility) is shown in the image on the bottom left. 
</ul>

<p>Besides the driving style, the stability depends on the traffic
      density. Furthermore, the traffic density is related to the
      local speed and the local flow (vehicles per time unit and
      per lane) by the so-called <i>fundamental diagramm</i>.
 Both relations can be illustrated by a so-called
    <i>stability diagram</i>:</p>
    
<p>In each diagram (the left one is for more agile, and the right one
      for more sluggish drivers), the black curve denotes the local flow as a
      function of the local density (fundamental
      diagram). Furthermore, the stability regions with respect to
      density are separated by the vertical coloured lines denoting
      the following:</p>


<ul>
<li> Traffic is absolutely stable to the left of the red line 
(density <i>&rho; &lt; &rho;<sub>1</sub></i>, free traffic)
 and to the right of the blue line
(<i>&rho; &gt; &rho;<sub>4</sub></i>, nearly standing traffic).
 Notice that there is no blue
    line in the right diagram corresponding to the less agile drivers,
    i.e., traffic flow does not "restabilize" in this case (at least
    if there is not a complete standstill corresponding to "stable"
    traffic, for trivial reasons). 
<li> Traffic is convectively unstable inside the density region
      bounded by the violet dotted (left) or solid (right) lines 
(density <i>&rho;= &rho;<sub>cv</sub></i>), and the blue dotted lines
(<i>&rho;= &rho;<sub>3</sub></i>).
<li> Traffic is absolutely string unstable inside the density region
      bounded by the violet dotted
(density <i>&rho;= &rho;<sub>2</sub></i>) and solid lines
(<i>&rho;= &rho;<sub>cv</sub></i>). Notice that this instability type
    only exists for the more sluggish drivers.
<li> Finally, there exist regions of <i> nonlinear instability</i> or
       <i>metastability</i>. Therefore, only strong perturbations lead to
      (generally convective) instabilities while small perturbations
      fade away.
</ul>

<h2 id="phaseDia">From the Stability to the Phase Diagram</h2>

<p>
The stability diagram as discussed above has been developed for an infinite homogeneous road
      section. However, all real road networks are inhomogeneous.
Furthermore, as illustrated by the image data base, 
      traffic breaksdowns occur near
<a href="?site=phaenomene&lang=en"> bottlenecks </a> in the overwelming
      majority of all cases. 
The decisive attribute of a bottleneck is its <i> bottleneck
	strength</i> which is defined by the local reduction of the
      capacity with respect to the neighboring sections, or,
      equivalently, by the <i> local capacity</i> at the bottleneck,
      i.e., the maximum mainroad traffic flow that can pass the bottleneck
      without causing congestions. Consequently, the flow of congested
      traffic behind a bottleneck is determined by the bottleneck
      capacity. (More precisely, there are two bottleneck capacities, one for free
      flow, and one after breakdown, i.e., after "activation" of the
      bottleneck, that are separated by the so-called <i> capacity
	drop</i>. However, this distinctiopn is not relevant here.) 

<p>This means the controlling variable in real congestions is <i>
	not</i> the density but the <i>flow</i>. Consequently, in order
      to derive 
      the phase diagram of traffic patterns in open systems, one must
      swap the x and y axes of the stability diagram. However, the
      inversion is not unique  since, for a given flow, there are two
      (or zero) values of the density. This ambiguity can be
      resolved by taking care of the direction of information
      propagation of traffic flow:</p>
    
<ul>
<li> For free traffic, the information direction is <i>pointed downstream</i> and
the flow is determined by the mainroad traffic demand
	entering the system. The density and the corresponding instability
	type can be read from the  <i>free branch</i> of the
	stability diagram to the left of the flow maxium.</li>
<li> After a breakdown,  the information direction is <i>pointed upstream</i> 
and the flow of the congested traffic is determined by the bottleneck
	capacity. The density and the corresponding instability
	type can be read from the  <i>congested branch</i> of the
	stability diagram to the right of the flow maximum.</li>
</ul>


<p>As a consequence, the stability of traffic in realistic open
      systems with bottleneck depends on the traffic demand, the
      bottleneck strength, and the driving style. Each stability type
      results in different characteristic spatiotemporal properties of
    the congestion after a breakdown has occurred:</p>

<br><span id="bildunterschrift">Phase diagram of moderately agile drivers 
</span></span>
<!-- ###################### -->

<p>Each of the resulting patterns is also called a 
    <i>dynamic phase</i>. The systematic plot of the dynamic phases
      as a function of the exogeneous variables traffic demand,
      bottleneck strength, the severity of the perturbation, 
and the driving style parameters, is also called
      a <i>phase diagram</i>.


<p>The depicted phase diagrams display the traffic phases as a
      function of the onramp bottleneck strength (which essentially is
      given by the 
      onramp inflow <i>Q<sub>rmp</sub></i>), and the traffic demand 
Q<sub>main</sub> on the main road. These phase diagrams represent the
    real situation for most freeways, including the freeway section
    shown in the image database. The
<a
      href="JavaScript:newPopup('html/userimages/elemPatternsIDM_ger.png');">
congested traffic patterns</a> can be explained
    as follows:</p>



<ol>
<li><b>Free traffic:</b> This is the case if the road network can
	handle the traffic demand, i.e., the sum of the main and ramp
	inflows is below the capacity of the freeway downstream of the
	bottleneck,
<i>Q<sub>main</sub> + Q<sub>rmp</sub> &lt; Q<sub>max</sub></i>.

<li> <b> Isolated moving jams (moving localized clusters, MLC):</b> 
This pattern may emerge if free traffic flow is in the metastable
      density range and there is a strong local perturbation in the
      traffic flow. In theory, no bottleneck is necessary for this
      type of pattern. In reality, however, a perturbation of sufficient strength
      can only be realized if a moving perturbation inside the traffic flow (such as
      an inconsiderate lane-changing maneuver or "running elephants")
      crosses a bottleneck, see "three ingredients to make a jam"</li>

<li> <b>Homogeneous lightly congested traffic (homogeneous
	synchronized patterns, HST):</b> 
This type of pattern emerges for small
      bottlenecks and sufficient traffic demand (otherwise,  there is no
      breakdown at all), if the resulting density on the congested
      branch of the stability diagram is below &rho;<sub>2</sub>. 
Since this condition implies congested traffic with comparatively low
      densities and high flows, this pattern can only be obtained for
    small bottlenecks.</li>

<li> <b>Stop-and-go traffic (triggered stop-and-go waves, TSG, and
	oscillating congested traffic, OCT):</b> This pattern emerges
      if the inflow is sufficiently high for causing a traffic
      breakdown, and the bottleneck strength is in a (medium) range
such that the resulting congested traffic is convectively
      unstable. Since the oscillations grow only in the upstream direction,
      traffic is nearly homogeneous near the bottleneck, and
      oscillatory further upstream. However, unlike the idealized case
      considered in the stability diagram, the perturbations near the
      bottleneck (merging zones) are sustained. Consequently, the 
oscillations will not be convected away completely.<p>
<i>Practical hint:</i> If you are stuck inside a traffic congestion
	and experience distinct traffic oscillations, you are in bad luck
	since you probably are yet far away from the bottleneck. On
	the other hand, If there are no distinct oscillations, 
 you may hope to pass
	the bottleneck (i.e., the end of the jam) in a short while!</li>

<li> <b>Homogeneous heavily congested traffic (HCT):</b>
	This happens for strong bottlenecks leading to strongly
      congested flow whose density is above &rho;<sub>3</sub> (only
    strong perturbations may lead to stop-and-go waves), or above
    &rho;<sub>4</sub> (absolutely stable). Notice that such a density
    range does not exist in all models for all parameter
    ranges. Moreover, it cannot  be observed
    conclusively in real data.
 Consequently, the existence of HCT is controversial. </li> 

<li> <b>Standing jam waves (pinned localized clusters, PLC):</b>
	This is a consequence of the metastability, and also of the
      capacity drop mentioned above.</li>

<p>Of course, the real test of all these concepts consists in
      comparing the predictions of the theories and models with the
      observed patterns. In fact, all characteristic traffic patterns

      dynamics with a 
 <a href="?site=methode&lang=en">dedicated method</a>: All patterns of
      the figure to the left are taken from the image database. Notice,
      however, that the majority of the observed congestions
      (including that showed at the beginning of this page) are
      composite patterns containing several of the elementary patterns
      defining the traffic phases. See the <a
